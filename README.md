# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to AoC 2021, this time in Rust, hopefully I won't give up.

I don't know Rust at all though, so that might be tough.

Since it's going pretty well I'll try to have decently fast solutions, below 5ms of execution on release build on my PC.

## Create new puzzle

`./create.sh [day]`

## Running

Put the input into `inputs/day[n].txt` file, then run:

`cargo run --bin day[n]`
